* Description
Given a string s and a string t, check if s is subsequence of t.

You may assume that there is only lower case English letters in both s and t. t is potentially a very long (length ~= 500,000) string, and s is a short string (<=100).

A subsequence of a string is a new string which is formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. (ie, "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde" while "aec" is not).

Example 1:
s = "abc", t = "ahbgdc"

Return true.

Example 2:
s = "axc", t = "ahbgdc"

Return false.

Follow up:
If there are lots of incoming S, say S1, S2, ... , Sk where k >= 1B, and you want to check one by one to see if T has its subsequence. In this scenario, how would you change your code?

* Solution
#+begin_src python
class Solution:
    def isSubsequence(self, s: str, t: str) -> bool:
        s_i = t_i = 0
        while s_i < len(s) and t_i < len(t):
            if s[s_i] == t[t_i]:
                s_i += 1
                t_i += 1
            else:
                t_i += 1
        if s_i == len(s):
            return True
        return False
