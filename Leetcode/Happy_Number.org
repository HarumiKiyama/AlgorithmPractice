* Description
Write an algorithm to determine if a number is "happy".

A happy number is a number defined by the following process: Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits, and repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), or it loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1. Those numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy numbers.

Example:

Input: 19
Output: true
Explanation:
12 + 92 = 82
82 + 22 = 68
62 + 82 = 100
12 + 02 + 02 = 1

* Solution
#+begin_src python
  class Solution:
      def isHappy(self, n: int) -> bool:
          def _cal(n):
              rv = 0
              while n > 9:
                  rv +=  (n % 10) ** 2
                  n = n // 10
              rv += n ** 2
              return rv
          exists = set()
          while n != 1 and n not in exists:
              exists.add(n)
              n = _cal(n)
          if n != 1:
              return False
          return True
