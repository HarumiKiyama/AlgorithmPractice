* Description
You're given strings J representing the types of stones that are jewels, and S representing the stones you have.  Each character in S is a type of stone you have.  You want to know how many of the stones you have are also jewels.

The letters in J are guaranteed distinct, and all characters in J and S are letters. Letters are case sensitive, so "a" is considered a different type of stone from "A".
* Solution
#+BEGIN_SRC cpp
  #include <iostream>
  using namespace std;

  class Solution {
  public:
    int numJewelsInStones(string J, string S) {
      int res = 0;
      for (unsigned i = 0; i < S.length(); i++) {
        if (J.find(S[i]) != string::npos) {
          res += 1;
        }
      }
      return res;
    }
  };
