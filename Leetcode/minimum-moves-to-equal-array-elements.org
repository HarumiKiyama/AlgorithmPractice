* Description
Given a non-empty integer array of size n, find the minimum number of moves required to make all array elements equal, where a move is incrementing n - 1 elements by 1.

Example:

Input:
[1,2,3]

Output:
3

Explanation:
Only three moves are needed (remember each move increments two elements):

[1,2,3]  =>  [2,3,3]  =>  [3,4,3]  =>  [4,4,4]
* Solution
#+begin_src python
class Solution:
    def minMoves(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        min_v = min(nums)
        rv = 0
        for i in nums:
            rv += i - min_v
        return rv
