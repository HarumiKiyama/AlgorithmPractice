* Description
Given a binary search tree with non-negative values, find the minimum absolute difference between values of any two nodes.

Example:

Input:

   1
    \
     3
    /
   2

Output:
1

Explanation:
The minimum absolute difference is 1, which is the difference between 2 and 1 (or between 2 and 3).

#+begin_src python
class Solution:
    def getMinimumDifference(self, root: TreeNode) -> int:
        rv = 2 ** 32
        pre = None
        def _helper(root):
            nonlocal rv, pre
            if root is None:
                return
            _helper(root.left)
            if pre is not None:
                rv = min(rv, root.val - pre)
            pre = root.val
            _helper(root.right)
        _helper(root)
