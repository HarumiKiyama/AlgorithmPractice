* Description
You are given two sorted arrays, A and B, where A has a large enough buffer at the end to hold B. Write a method to merge B into A in sorted order.

Initially the number of elements in A and B are m and n respectively.

Example:

Input:
A = [1,2,3,0,0,0], m = 3
B = [2,5,6],       n = 3

Output: [1,2,2,3,5,6]
* Solution
#+begin_src python
class Solution:
    def merge(self, A: List[int], m: int, B: List[int], n: int) -> None:
        """
        Do not return anything, modify A in-place instead.
        """
        if len(B) == 0:
            return
        for i in range(m):
            if A[i] > B[0]:
                A[i], B[0] = B[0], A[i]
                for j in range(1, n):
                    if B[j] < B[j-1]:
                        B[j], B[j-1] = B[j-1], B[j]
                    else:
                        break
        for j in range(n):
            A[m + j] = B[j]
