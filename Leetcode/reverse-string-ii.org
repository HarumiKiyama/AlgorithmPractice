* Description
Given a string and an integer k, you need to reverse the first k characters for every 2k characters counting from the start of the string. If there are less than k characters left, reverse all of them. If there are less than 2k but greater than or equal to k characters, then reverse the first k characters and left the other as original.

Example:

Input: s = "abcdefg", k = 2
Output: "bacdfeg"

Restrictions:

    The string consists of lower English letters only.
    Length of the given string and k will in the range [1, 10000]

#+begin_src python
class Solution:
    def reverseStr(self, s: str, k: int) -> str:
        s = list(s)
        last = 0
        def reverse(start, end):
            while start < end:
                s[start], s[end] = s[end], s[start]
                start += 1
                end -= 1

        for i in range(len(s)):
            if i % (2*k) == 2*k -1:
                reverse(i-2*k+1, i-k)
                last = i + 1
        if last == len(s):
            return ''.join(s)
        if len(s) - last <= k:
            reverse(last, len(s) -1)
        else:
            reverse(last, last+k - 1)
        return ''.join(s)
