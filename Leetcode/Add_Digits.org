* Description
Given a non-negative integer num, repeatedly add all its digits until the result has only one digit.

Example:

Input: 38
Output: 2
Explanation: The process is like: 3 + 8 = 11, 1 + 1 = 2.
             Since 2 has only one digit, return it.

Follow up:
Could you do it without any loop/recursion in O(1) runtime?
* Solution
#+BEGIN_SRC cpp
  #include <iostream>

  using namespace std;

  class Solution {
  public:
    int addDigits(int num) {
      if (num == 0)
        return 0;
      return 1 + (num-1) % 9;
    }
  };
#+END_SRC
