* Description
We are playing the Guess Game. The game is as follows:

I pick a number from 1 to n. You have to guess which number I picked.

Every time you guess wrong, I'll tell you whether the number is higher or lower.

You call a pre-defined API guess(int num) which returns 3 possible results (-1, 1, or 0):

-1 : My number is lower
 1 : My number is higher
 0 : Congrats! You got it!

Example :

Input: n = 10, pick = 6
Output: 6
* Solution
#+BEGIN_SRC cpp
  #include <iostream>
  using namespace std;

  int guess(int num);

  class Solution {
  public:
    int guessNumber(int n) {
      int left = 1;
      int middle{0};
      int res{0};
      while (left < n) {
        middle = left + (n - left) / 2;
        res = guess(middle);
        if (res == 0){
          return middle;
        }
        else if (res == -1) {
          n = middle - 1;
        } else {
          left = middle + 1;
        }
      }
      return n;
    }
  };
