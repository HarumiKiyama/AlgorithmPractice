-- Group the elements of a set into disjoint subsets.
-- a) In how many ways can a group of 9 people work in 3 disjoint subgroups of 2, 3 and 4 persons? Write a function that generates all the possibilities and returns them in a list.
-- b) Generalize the above predicate in a way that we can specify a list of group sizes and the predicate will return a list of groups.
