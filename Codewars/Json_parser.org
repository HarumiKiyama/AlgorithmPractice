JSON is a simple data-interchange format that is based on a simplified version of JavaScript's object notation. The official website has a great description of the language.

For the purposes of this kata we will use a simplified version of JSON. Specifically, you may ignore numbers with exponents and strings with Unicode and escape sequences. The updated parts of the specification are as follows

#+BEGIN_SRC haskell
  module Main where

  data Value
    = String String
    | Number Double
    | Object [(Value, Value)] -- an association list -- only a `String` is valid as the index `Value`
    | Array [Value] -- not limited to identical primitive datatypes
    | Boolean Bool -- either `True` or `False`
    | Null

  parse :: String->Maybe Value
  parse n = Nothing

  main :: IO()
  main = putStr "Hello"
#+END_SRC
